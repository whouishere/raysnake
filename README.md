# RaySnake

Simple snake game made with [raylib][raylib]!

You can play RaySnake from your browser on https://whou.codeberg.page/raysnake.

### TODO:
- multi-threaded
- more flexible grid and graphics
- gameplay twist

## Building
### Requirements
- A C99 compatible compiler
- CMake >= 3.11
- A working raylib installation (optional)

If you have these simple requirements, use

```
cmake -B build/ -S .
cmake --build build/
```

If you want a debug build, pass `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to the first `cmake` command.

If you don't have raylib 4.5 installed for CMake, it will fetch the raylib source from GitHub and build it automatically for you.

Then the built binary will be on the `build` directory.

### Web build
It's also possible to play the game on the browser with WebAssembly. To build a target for browsers, first follow [Emscripten][emscripten]'s install instructions and use a slightly different `cmake` command:

```
emcmake cmake -B build/emscripten -S . -DPLATFORM=Web
cmake --build build/emscripten
```

Now you can setup a web server with Python to test the output:

```
python -m http.server -d build/emscripten
```

The game will now be available on `http://localhost:8000/raysnake.html`.

Have fun! :)
