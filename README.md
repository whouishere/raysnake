# RaySnake

Simple snake game made with [raylib][raylib]!

### TODO:
- simple, small, and fast high score file encryption
- multi-threaded
- more flexible grid and graphics
- gameplay twist

## Building
### Requirements
- A C99 compatible compiler
- CMake >= 3.11
- A working raylib installation (optional)

If you have these simple requirements, use

```
cmake -B build/ -S .
cmake --build build/
```

If you want a debug build, pass `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to the first `cmake` command.

If you don't have raylib 4.0 installed for CMake, it will fetch the raylib source from GitHub and build it automatically for you.

Then the built binary will be on the `build` directory.

Have fun! :)
